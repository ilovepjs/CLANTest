The Multitasker Test 
=========

The Multitasker test is designed to test how well you can focus on different things going on all at once. Each time you get something wrong, you lose a point. The aim is to score as high as possible and not lose any points. There's a hosted version over at http://multitasker.preeya.me if you want to play.

During the game:

> 
> I. Red, yellow and green diamonds move from the left into coloured bands (red, green, yellow left-right). When they reach the coloured band you must ‘cancel’ them using the coloured buttons. This only works when the diamond is completely within the band, if even a tip is out, it will not register. Wrong or surplus keys used here lose 1 point, correct keys gain 1 point.
> 
> II. Simple mathematical problems appear at the bottom of the screen, involving addition, subtraction, multiplication and division of numbers 1-12, 15 and 20.
Each correct answer gives 1 point, wrong answers lose 1 point.
> 
> III. Every 15-20 seconds, 5-9 alphanumeric digits appear at the top for a few seconds. 12 seconds later, four similar options are presented at each corner of the screen; you must select the option which appeared previously using W/E/S/D.
